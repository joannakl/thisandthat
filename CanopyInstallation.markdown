Canopy is a Python IDE (integrated development environment) provided by 
[Enthought Scientific Computing Solutions](https://www.enthought.com/). 
It provides a simple code editor, runtime environment and easy way for 
installation of hundreds of scientific Python packages. 

Here is how to get it up and running. 

#Installation on Windows 

These installation instructions have been tested on Windows 10, but should work
also for other versions of the Windows operating system.

1. Go to the website for Canopy: [https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)  
and select Canopy from the *Downloads* list (at the very top of the page) or go 
directly to the [*Downloads*](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/) page.

2. Select the version with the highest number for the operating system that you are
using (should be Windows if you are looking at this set of instructions). 
Unless you are certain that you have an older machine still running a 32 bit 
system, you should pick Windows[64-bit]. Currently the highest version of Canopy is 3.5. 

3. The download may take a while since the file is fairly large. Once the download 
completes, go to your `Downloads` directory and you should see a file called `canopy-2.1.3.win-x86_64-cp35`
(keep in mind that the numbers in the name might be slightly different if the version
number is different. <br>
Double click on that file to run the installer. (There is a chance that Windows will ask you 
if you want to run the installed right after the download completes. If that is the case, you do not
need to find the file and run it yourself.)

4. You can now run Canopy. To start it go to your application menu or use the 
shortcut that was placed on your Desktop. <br> 
When you run the program for the first time, it needs to finish the installation process, so it
may take a bit of extra time. 

5. You should be looking at the following window once Canopy starts:

Before starting to code, we will make sure that all the Python packages are up to date
and we will install some additional packages needed to produce plots and graphs. 
6. Select *Package Manager* from he above screen. Pick *Updates* from the menu on the 
left hand side. The number next to it, indicates the number of packages that can be updated.
Click on the *Upgrade all packages* link (shown with a blue background in the image below)
and accept the list of packages to be upgraded when prompted.

7. Don't leave the *Package Manager* just yet. Pick *Available* from the menu on the left hand side. Use the search window (upper right corner) and search for "pyqt". Select
the package in the list of results and click *Install* (the button on a  blue background). 
8. Now close the *Package Manager* and open the *Editor* to run the test program. 
    - From the menu select *File*, *New* and *Python 3 File* (or use the first icon in the toolbar; it should be the *Create new file* icon). 
    - Save the empty file to a location for your Python programs (it should not be directly on your Desktop, but rather in a directory dedicated for your coursework). 
    From the menu select *File*, *Save As*, browse to an appropriate directory and enter the 
    name of the file as `test1.py` - note that the extension **`.py`** is very important here!
    - Paste the following text as the content of the file. Make sure that you copy the text
    exactly
    
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from numpy import  arange, sin, cos, pi

x = arange(0, 2*pi, 0.1)
y1 = sin(x)
y2 = cos(x)

plt.plot(x,y1,'r')
plt.plot(x,y2,'b')

plt.grid(True)

plt.show() 
```

    - Run the program by either selecting from the menu *Run* followed by *Run File* or 
    clicking on the green arrow icon labeled *Run the current file* in the toolbar. 
    You should see the following plot generated by the program.
